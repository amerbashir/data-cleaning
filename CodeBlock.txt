Steps To produce tidydata.txt
1. Software Used:
	RStudio Version 1.0.143 – © 2009-2016 RStudio, Inc.
2. R Packages Used
	plyr
	data.table
3. Downloaded all the data INPUT files to the local directory:
	"C:/Users/ABashir/Documents/CourseEra/Courses/3-CleaningData/Week4/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Read the Training data from the subdirectory "train"
	dtSubjectTrain <- read.table("./train/subject_train.txt", header = FALSE)
	dtXTrain <- read.table("./train/X_train.txt", header=FALSE)
	dtYTrain <- read.table("./train/y_train.txt", header=FALSE)
5. Read the test data from the subdirectory "test"
	dtSubjectTest = read.table('./test/subject_test.txt',header=FALSE)
	dtXTest = read.table('./test/x_test.txt',header=FALSE)
	dtYTest = read.table('./test/y_test.txt',header=FALSE)

6. Merged the training and the test corresponding data sets to create one data set for each data set.
7. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
8. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
9 Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
10. Combined the processed data into one data set.
11. Assigned descriptive names to the dataset columns 
12. Created the aggregated data for the tidy data set (tidydata.txt.
